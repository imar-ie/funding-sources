## Phased Support {#phased-support}

### Feasibility assessment (phase 1) - optional {#feasibility-assessment-phase-1-optional}

**Funding is available for:** exploring and assessing the technical feasibility and commercial potential of a breakthrough innovation that a company wants to exploit and commercialize.

Activities funded could be: risk assessment, design or market studies, intellectual property exploration; the ultimate goal is to put a new product, service or process in the market, possibly through an innovative application of existing technologies, methodologies, or business processes.

The project should be aligned to the business strategy, helping internal growth or targeting a transnational business opportunity.

*   **Amount of funding:** lump sum of €50,000 (per project, not per participating business).
*   **Duration:** typically around 6 months
*   **Outcome**: The outcome of a phase 1 project is a feasibility study (technical and commercial), including a business plan.

Should the conclusion of the study be that the innovative concept has the potential to be developed to the level of investment readiness/market maturity, but requires additional funding in view of commercialisation, the SME can apply for Phase 2 support.

### Innovation project (phase 2) {#innovation-project-phase-2}

**Funding is available for:** innovation projects underpinned by a sound and strategic business plan (potentially elaborated and partially funded through phase 1 of the SME Instrument).

Activities funded in phase 2 can be of several types: prototyping, miniaturisation, scaling-up, design, performance verification, testing, demonstration, development of pilot lines, validation for market replication, including other activities aimed at bringing innovation to investment readiness and maturity for market take-up.

*   **Amount of funding:** in the indicative range of €500,000 – € 2.5 million or more (covering up to 70% of eligible costs, or in exceptional, specific cases up to 100%).
*   **Duration:** typically around 1 to 2 years
*   **Outcomes:**
    *   a new product, process or service that is ready to face market competition;
    *   a business innovation plan incorporating a detailed commercialisation strategy and a financing plan in view of market launch (e.g. on how to attract private investors, if applicable).

### Commercialisation (phase 3) {#commercialisation-phase-3}

With the view of facilitating the commercial exploitation of the innovation activities resulting from phase 1 or phase 2, specific activities will be proposed. These can include support for further developing investment readiness, linking with private investors and customers through brokerage activities, assistance in applying for further EU risk finance, and a range of other innovation support activities and services offered via the [Enterprise Europe Network (EEN)](http://een.ec.europa.eu/services/overview).

### Coaching {#coaching}

Innovation and Business development coaching is proposed in parallel throughout phases 1 and 2 to help SMEs:

*   enhance the company's innovation capacity
*   align the project to the identified business development strategy
*   develop the commercial/economic impact and long term sustainability.

Coaching will be provided by experienced business coaches, selected through the [Enterprise Europe Network (EEN)](http://een.ec.europa.eu/).
