## The SME Instrument {#the-sme-instrument}

Small and Medium-sized Enterprises that are EU-based or established in a country associated to Horizon 2020 can now get EU funding and support for innovation projects that will help them grow and expand their activities into other countries – in Europe and beyond.

Horizon 2020 funds high-potential innovation through a dedicated SME instrument, which offers seamless business innovation support under the section [Societal Challenges](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/societal-challenges) and the specific part [Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies (LEITs)](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/leadership-enabling-and-industrial-technologies).

Provided with about € 3 billion in funding over the period 2014-2020, the SME Instrument helps high-potential SMEs to develop groundbreaking innovative ideas for products, services or processes that are ready to face global market competition. Available to SMEs only, which can however organise a project in the way that best fits their business needs – meaning that subcontracting is not excluded – the new scheme has opened a new highway to innovation through phased, progressive and complimentary support.
