Údarás na Gaeltachta can provide assistance by way of capital grant to enterprises seeking aid for an initial investment for capital expenditure costs.Instances where a proposed investment qualifies as an initial investment include the following:

*   The setting up of a new establishment
*   The extension of an existing establishment
*   Diversification of the output of an establishment into new, additional products
*   A fundamental change in the overall production process of an existing establishment.

In this case the acquisition of the capital assets refers directly to an establishment, where the establishment has closed or would have closed had it not been purchased, and the assets are bought by an independent investor. The sole acquisition of the shares of an undertaking does not constitute initial investment.

Capital grants can be paid for initial investment in material and immaterial assets.

Material assets refers to assets relating to land, building and plant and machinery. Immaterial assets refer to assets entailed by the transfer of technology through the acquisition of patent rights, license know-how or unpatented technical knowledge.
