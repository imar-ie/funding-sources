Enterprises embarking on an initial investment project may apply for assistance towards job creation costs. Referred to as an employment grant, aid is calculated by reference to the expected wage costs over the first two years of jobs created as a result of an initial investment project.

Under the Employment Grants’ Initiative, an tÚdarás may provide grant aid to businesses to cover the cost of employing staff on a full-time or part-time basis with the amount of aid payable varying with the required skill level and the related cost of staff. The geographic location of a project also impacts on the amount of aid payable.

Half of the grant aid is paid when the job commences and the balance is normally paid when the job has been in existence for six months.
